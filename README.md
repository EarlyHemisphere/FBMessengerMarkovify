# FBMessengerMarkovify
A python script that trains itself with a FB Messenger conversation and tries to make its own messages based on that chat.

## Setup

The setup is very simple, and is only a two step process. Your facebook data is not needed - the email to your facebook account is all it takes.

1) Run the following python imports:
```
pip install fbchat
pip install markovify
```
2) Fill in your username and chat name in the config file.
