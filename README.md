# FBMessengerMarkovify
A python script that trains itself with a FB Messenger conversation and tries to make its own messages based on that chat.

NOTE: This does not require finding, downloading, or interacting with your facebook data in any way!

## Setup

The setup is very simple, and is only a two step process. Your facebook data is not needed - the email and password to your facebook account is all it takes!

1) Run the following python imports:

    pip install fbchat
    pip install markovify
    
2) Fill in your username and chat name in the config file.

That's it!
